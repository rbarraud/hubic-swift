hubic-swift
==========

This is a wrapper arround swift to connect to the OAUTH as available
in hubic.

Dependency
----------

You obviously need to have swift to run this as it is only a wrapper.
You also need ruby and some of its gems : mechanize, logger and highline.

On debian,

    apt-get install swift ruby ruby-mechanize ruby-logger ruby-highline

will install everything that is needed. By the way this has only been
tested on Debian, but should work on any recent GNU/Linux.

You also need a `client_id` and `client_secret`. To have them,
register an application in your hubic
[account](https://hubic.com/home/browser/developers/), I use
`http://localhost:4567/` as a redirect_uri. You could use
anything else, but will have to change the value of `REDIRECT_URI` in
the source code.

I also use the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (`echo $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` to see if it's
configured) and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (or ~/.config) to put some config
files. And I use the `xdg-user-dir` (found in the `xdg-user-dirs`
debian package).

Running it
----------
The first time it run, it will ask for your `client_id`,
`client_secret`, and hubic username. It will store those information
in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hubic-swift/creds`. It will also ask your
password to ask hubic for the identifying token swift will use.
It will store in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hubic-swift` those token for latter
use, and will try to refresh them when needed.

Afterward it will just call swift, so for example

    ./hubic-swift list default

will run

    swift --os-auth-token "somesecret" --os-storage-url "https://somwhere.hubic.com/somepath" list default

then swift will list what is in you default container.

Storing your password
---------------------

If you are fed up to enter your password too often, you can store it
in the creds file. Note that this is unsafe.

Open `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hubic-swift/creds`. It will look like

    {"CLIENT_ID":"api_hubic_longstring","CLIENT_SECRET":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","USERNAME":"me@example.com"}

You have to add `"PASSWD":"mysecretpassword"` there:

    {"CLIENT_ID":"api_hubic_longstring","CLIENT_SECRET":"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","USERNAME":"me@example.com","PASSWD":"mysecretpassword"}

This is unsafe, but I don't now how the official client store this
information, and it might not be safer.

BUGS
----
No error detection is done. The way the hubic and openstack token are
store might be unsafe. I should probably try to find a safe for them.

If something stop working you could try

    ./hubic-swift --cleanup

to remove the connexion token, and so to force hubic-swift to
reconnect.
